# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [v0.4.0] - 2019-12-19

### Added
- `created` and `updated` fields added to item properties
- `serverless` deployment configuration file (serverless.yml)

### Changed
- `time` field renamed to `datetime`
- Error raised if both bbox and intersection are specified
- Search metadata changed to match the `search` extension
- Intersect parameter accepts only GeoJSON geometries

### Removed
- `fields` filter due to issues with default behavior. To be added back in for STAC 0.9.0 which reworks how fields filter works
- Batch ingestion jobs with Fargate


## [v0.3.0] - 2019-10-16

### Added
- /stac/search linked to from /stac
- New `ids` parameter added for searching by IDs
- New `collections` parameter added for searching list of specific collections
- SATAPI_COLLECTION_LIMIT environment variable added for the number of collections to return at the /stac and /collections endpoints. Since pagination is not supported at these endpoints this should be set higher than the number of collections available. Defaults to 100.

### Changed
- Fields parameter changed to search on any fields rather than just fields under `properties`. Field under `properties` must now be referenced by `properties.<fieldname>`
- `collection` now a top level field rather than a property


## [v0.2.6] - 2019-08-28

### Added
- Support for `in` operator on property fields
- SATAPI_COLLECTION_LIMIT environment variable added for the number of collections to return at the /stac and /collections endpoints. Since pagination is not supported at these endpoints this should be set higher than the number of collections available. Defaults to 100.

### Added
- /stac/search linked to from /stac
- New `ids` parameter added for searching by IDs
- New `collections` parameter added for searching list of specific collections

### Changed
- Fields parameter changed to search on any fields rather than just fields under `properties`. `property` fields must now be referenced by `property.fieldname`
- `collection` now a top level field rather than a property


## [v0.2.5] - 2019-06-21

### Fixed
- Added missing dependency (through2)

### Removed
- Removed gzip compression which caused problems with APIGateway. Use APIGateway to enable compression instead rather than in the library.

## [v0.2.4] - 2019-06-02

### Added
- Add `fields` filter to return only specific fields
- Added SATAPI_URL environment variable for defining a custom root URL used for creating hierarchical links. Otherwise, the root URL will try to be inferred from the headers.
- Gzip compression added for clients that support it (via `Accept-Encoding`)
- Added SATAPI_ES_PRECISION environment variable to change the precision for underlying intersection geometry queries. This will have an adverse impact on performance and storage size. If changed after ingestion, a reindex operation will need to be performed. It defaults to '5mi' (5 miles).

### Fixed
- Fix datetime range to be inclusive (i.e., gte and lte)
- Fixed `next` links to properly stringify geometries


## [v0.2.3] - 2019-01-29

### Fixed
- Proper handling of bounding box passed as string

### Changed
- De-normalize Item properties to include all properties from collection
- Flattened elastic search to simplify query logic
- Items returned will now include all 'Common' properties that are in the Items Collection

## [v0.2.2] - 2019-01-21

### Fixed
- Fix error handling of single Items written to Elasticsearch.

## [v0.2.1] - 2019-01-17

### Fixed
- Error handling of Items failing to get written to Elasticsearch (such as when unable to parse geometry). Now will continue traversing catalog.


## [v0.2.0] - 2019-01-16

### Changed
- Implemented the changes in [STAC 0.6.0](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
- All functionality relating to handling a STAC API path and query parameters has been moved into a the api.js module. The simplified lambda handler now passes query parameters or POST body through to the `api.js` module.
- API now only supports STAC compliant query parameters and filters.
- All functionality and references relating to Elasticsearch have been migrated into the es.js module to faciltate separation of concerns and abstract data storage.
- Refactored Elasticsearch queries and ES mappings to search and share fields with the properties nested type. Now, only fields under a Collections properties are inherited by the Item.
- Elasticsearch queries have been updated to use non-scoring filters to improve performance and return more intuitive results.
- Elasticsearch writing has been modified to use bulk updates whenever possible to improve throughput.
- Ingest has been updated to use concurrent file requests (to a user defined limit) to improve throughput.
- Ingest now supports a Fargate mode to run as a Fargate task rather than as a Lambda.
- API documentation generation now uses OpenAPI definitions processed by widdershins and shins.
- Unit and integration test coverage for all  modules.

### Removed
- Manager module: Removed in favor of Kibana for Elasticsearch administration and management tasks.
- Landsat and Sentinel lambda functions: Data is now ingested via the ingest Lambda.  It can be invoked with individual SNS messages or run in batch mode to ingest larger catalogs.
- Deployment files: Deployment related templates and code have been migrated to [https://github.com/sat-utils/sat-api-deployment](https://github.com/sat-utils/sat-api-deployment)

## [v0.1.0] - 2018-09-18

### Fixed
- Fixed broken ingests for Landsat and Sentinel

## [v0.0.2]

### Added
- Added support for [STAC specification](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/)
- The following packages are released
  - @sat-utils/api
  - @sat-utils/api-lib
  - @sat-utils/ingest
  - @sat-utils/landsat
  - @sat-utils/sentinel
  - @sat-utils/manager
- A new document is added on how to configure and deploy and instance of sat-api

### Changed
- All lambdas and packages moved to `/packages` and lerna is used for managing them
- npm packages are published under `@sat-utils` org on npm

### Removed
- /geojson endpoint
- /count endpoint

## [legacy-v2.0.0] - 2018-01-01

- Moves all the metadata indexing logics to the same repo
- Uses CloudFormation for full deployment
- Includes a better ApiGateway support
- Use streams to read, transform, and write into elasticsearch
- Use batches of lambdas to speed up processing
- Refactor several modules: metadata, landsat, sentinel
- Refactor and improve splitting
